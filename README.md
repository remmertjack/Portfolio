# Portfolio
Thank you for visiting my GitHub Portfolio! This Portfolio outlines some of my previous work in Machine Learning, In-Game Analysis, and Video/Data Reports. These projects were completed during my time as a graduate student at the Univeristy of Chichester and outside of the classroom. For any comments or questions, please email remmertjack@gmail.com. Thank you and enjoy!
